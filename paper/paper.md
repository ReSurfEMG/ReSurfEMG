# Summary


ReSurfEMG is an open source collaborative python library for analysis of respiratory electromyography (EMG).
 As many issues neccesary for interprettion of respiratory electromyography, such as onset of respirotory effort, concern both clinicians and technical specialists including software engineers, respiratory EMG data must be considered in by groups of professionalys who profoundly different computation skill levels. Therefore our package provides several interfaces that researchers can use to investiage different processing and analytic pipelines. The package not only allows for pre-processing and analysis with either command line or Jupyter notebooks, it supports a graphic user interface package which allows code free interaction with the data. [reference dashboard!]. The third interface for ReSurfEMG algorithms is through Jupyter notebooks, which allow researchers to run preset experiments, and extend them and record the results in csv files automatically.
ReSUrfEMG code allows for analysis of various parameters in respiratory durface EMG from simple ones e.g. area under curve to more complex ones such as entropy. These charecteristics can be used in machine learning models, which there is code in the notebooks to demonstrate. The current state of research in the field includes much scientific work without any published code and therefore it currently difficult to compare paramters such as entropy, as it may be calculated with various algorithms differently. This library enables communication towards reproducible research. 


# State of the field

Respiratory EMG signals can be processed by several existing libraries which deal with EMG signals. However none of these libraries have been extended to cover the specifics of the respiratory signal in depth. Biosppy [@ cite Biosppy], and Nuerokit [@ cite neurokit2] both cover processing for various electrophysiological signals, and have modules for general EMG processing. Unfortunately, these modules do not have code specific to respiratory EMG. pyemgpipline [@ cite pyemgpipeline] is specific to EMG, but nor respirator EMG. Without functions specific to respiratory EMG, researchers must code functions for even basic parameters such as area under curve in line with current literature themselves. This is beyond the capability of many researchers in the field. Therefore ReSurfEMG bridges the gaps in clinical researcher abilities, allowing investigators at a low level of technical skill to analize respiratory EMG.  


# Statement of need
When the diaphragm and/or other respiratory muscles fail, breathing needs mechanical support, and then it is essential to monitor respiratory muscle activity, both to prevent further failure and optimize treatment. Muscle activity can be measured invasively or measured by electrodes attached to the skin via an electromyogram (EMG). Yet, preprocessing and analysis of these inherently complex data sets of electromyographs, remains very limited due to various factors including proprietary software.
 At present there is a lack of internationally accepted respiratory surface EMG processing conventions. For example in order to determine where in a signal a breath, or inspiratory effort, begins one must determine the onset of muscle effort. However there are at least seven algorithms for muscle effort onset detection in the existing literature  [@HODGES1996511] [@661154] [@LIDIERTH1986378] [@https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2842.1998.00242.x] [@Solnik2010] [@10.1007/978-3-642-34546-3_71] [@londral2013wireless], and researchers sometimes simply determine onsets manually. As there is no consensus around respiratory effort onset, or most appropriate preprocessing algorithms to remove cardiac signals, comparing research across groups is difficult. 
 This package aims to create open preprocessing and analysis pipelines to further the use of this signal in clinical research that can be compared across institutions and across various acquisition hardware set-ups.
