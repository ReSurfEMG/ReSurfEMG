abstract = {Little consensus exists in the literature regarding methods for determination of the onset of electromyographic (EMG) activity. The aim of this study was to compare the relative accuracy of a range of computer-based techniques with respect to EMG onset determined visually by an experienced examiner. Twenty-seven methods were compared which varied in terms of EMG processing (low pass filtering at 10, 50 and 500 Hz), threshold value (1, 2 and 3 SD beyond mean of baseline activity) and the number of samples for which the mean must exceed the defined threshold (20, 50 and 100 ms). Three hundred randomly selected trials of a postural task were evaluated using each technique. The visual determination of EMG onset was found to be highly repeatable between days. Linear regression equations were calculated for the values selected by each computer method which indicated that the onset values selected by the majority of the parameter combinations deviated significantly from the visually derived onset values. Several methods accurately selected the time of onset of EMG activity and are recommended for future use.}

abstract = {SUMMARY A method of automated detection of onset and termination of rhythmic muscle activity in electromyograms (EMGs) is presented. A threshold level in the EMG is computed, such that amplitudes in the EMG signal exceeding this level indicate muscle activity. The threshold level is determined using a statistical criterion based on the amplitude distribution of the entire EMG signal. The working of the method is illustrated with EMG signals recorded from chewing muscles. EMG signals with a good as well as a worse signal-to-noise ratio are presented. The method can be used for any EMG signal containing cyclic bursts of activity and thus may be applied in studies on rhythmic movements, such as chewing, walking and breathing. An automated method of EMG burst detection has the advantage that large amounts of EMG data can be easily and objectively processed.},

abstract={Accurate identification of the onset of muscle activity is an important element in the biomechanical analysis of human movement. The purpose of this study was to determine if inclusion of the Teager--Kaiser energy operator (TKEO) in signal conditioning would increase the accuracy of popular electromyography (EMG) onset detection methods. Three methods, visual determination, threshold-based method, and approximated generalized likelihood ratio were used to estimate the onset of EMG burst with and without TKEO conditioning. Reference signals, with known onset times, were constructed from EMG signals collected during isometric contraction of the vastus lateralis (n = 17). Additionally, vastus lateralis EMG signals (n = 255) recorded during gait were used to evaluate a clinical application of the TKEO conditioning. Inclusion of TKEO in signal conditioning significantly reduced mean detection error of all three methods compared with signal conditioning without TKEO, using artificially generated reference data (13 vs. 98 ms, p < 0.001) and also compared with experimental data collected during gait (55 vs. 124 ms, p < 0.001). In conclusion, addition of TKEO as a step in conditioning surface EMG signals increases the detection accuracy of EMG burst boundaries.},

abstract={Biosignals have been extensively used within the field of Human- Computer Interaction (HCI) for the development of brain and neuronal computer interaction systems, in particular, targeting augmentative and alternative communication. Electromyography is a commonly used technique in this context, however, conventional signal acquisition procedures require the use of conductive paste or pre-gelled electrodes on the interface with the skin, thus introducing usability constraints and recurrent costs associated with the daily use. Our work is focused on the comparison between standard pre-gelled Ag/AgCl electrodes, dry Ag/AgCl electrodes and conductive fabrics, as a way of improving the usability of electromyographic interfaces for HCI. Experimental results have shown that dry and gelled electrodes perform similarly, thus applicability of alternative electrode materials, and further extending the toolbox of the rehabilitation engineer.},

abstract={NeuroKit2 is an open-source, community-driven, and user-centered Python package for neurophysiological signal processing. It provides a comprehensive suite of processing routines for a variety of bodily signals (e.g., ECG, PPG, EDA, EMG, RSP). These processing routines include high-level functions that enable data processing in a few lines of code using validated pipelines, which we illustrate in two examples covering the most typical scenarios, such as an event-related paradigm and an interval-related analysis. The package also includes tools for specific processing steps such as rate extraction and filtering methods, offering a trade-off between high-level convenience and fine-tuned control. Its goal is to improve transparency and reproducibility in neurophysiological research, as well as foster exploration and innovation. Its design philosophy is centred on user-experience and accessibility to both novice and advanced users.},
