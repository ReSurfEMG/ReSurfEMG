professionals** who do not spend most of their time coding.  At 
the end of this documentation is a link to our learning repository
which has some explanatory videos.

Introduction
============

`resurfemg` is a package meant to support tools for surface EMG interpretation.
Surface EMG interpretation is a rapidly evolving field without many standards.
We build interfaces for ongoing research in the form of Jupyter notebooks, 
as well as tools for clinical research. The main tool for clinical researchers is 
the dashboard. 
The dashboard is in a separate repository (https://github.com/resurfemg-org/ReSurfEMG-dashboard).
At present to create a dashboard for the first time you need to use some kind of terminal.
After you have created/installed the dashboard once, you will be able to run it like the
executable programs you are used to. If you want to get a new release you will need to repeat the process. 

If you have no idea what a terminal even is, grab a scientist or programmer, and
ask for 10 minutes of their time.

If you want to do more than collect data with preset filtering
pipelines, and actually do computational research with modern tools,
please visit our notebooks. You can copy one, alter it, and even send 
back a merge request on it if you feel the whole community
of researchers will benefit.

Our learning repository (https://github.com/ReSurfEMG/learning) has some videos on our project.
