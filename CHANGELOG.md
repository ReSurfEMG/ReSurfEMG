# Change Log

## Release 1.0.2
* Patch
	- Move ReSurfEMG repo from https://github.com/ReSurfEMG/ReSurfEMG/ to https://github.com/resurfemg-org/ReSurfEMG/

## Release 1.0.1
* Patch
	- Fix: config file generation from template showed unexpected behaviour in overwriting existing config files and failing when not_pushed did not exist.
