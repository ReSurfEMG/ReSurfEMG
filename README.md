### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ We are currently moving from a different repository, so our present state (which may include a few bugs)  is temporary. 

Nonetheless, this is the home of ReSurfEMG. Stay tuned.


### Folders and Notebooks


researcher_interface:
- These are a growing series of interactive notebooks that allow researchers to investigate questions about their own EMG data

open_work:
- This folder contains experimental work by core members of the rsemg team


### Program files

The main program in this repository contains functions for analysis of EMG.


## Data sets

The notebooks are configured to run on various datasets.
Contact Candace Makeda Moore (c.moore@esciencecenter.nl) to discuss any questions on data configuration. 

## Getting started

How to get the notebooks running? Assuming the raw data set and metadata is available.

1. Install all Python packages required, using conda and the environment.yml file.
1a. The command for Windows/Anaconda users can be something like: conda env create -f environment.yml
1b. Linux users can create their own environment by hand

2. Open a notebook in researcher_interface and interactively run the cells.

## Generating documentation
Up to date documentation can be generated in command-line as follows (in bash terminal):

``` sh
sphinx-apidoc -o ./docs  -f --separate ./resurfemg 
rm -rf ./build_documentation
mkdir ./build_documentation
sphinx-build -b html ./docs ./built_documentation
```

If you are working in a VScode command line interface (terminal cmd):

``` sh
sphinx-apidoc -o ./docs  -f --separate ./resurfemg 
rm -rf ./build_documentation
sphinx-build -b html ./docs ./built_documentation
```
